# IoT_Face_Reader
IoT Face Reader utilizing MS Cognitive Services Face &amp; Emotion APIs.

Seems to be UWP-compliant; runs on Raspberry Pi 3 &amp; x64 win10 desktop.

Instructions:
After the app loads, initialize the camera by clicking on the 'videoInit' button. This should cause a live webcam preview to pop up.
Once you have the desired face(s) in the preview frame, click on the 'shutter' button to capture a still image and process it using the Face/Emotion APIs. This will take a moment.
If there are multiple faces detected in a single frame, press the 'next face' button to cycle through attributes for each. A red square will be superimposed on the face associated with the displayed attributes.
